# Multi-Agent Routing - Quick Summary

## 🎯 The Big Picture

Transform Browzer from **single-agent hardcoded system** → **intelligent multi-agent orchestration platform**

## 🔑 Key Changes

### 1. **Smart Routing**
- ❌ Before: `extensionId = 'topic-agent'` (hardcoded)
- ✅ After: AI analyzes request → routes to best extension(s)

### 2. **Extension Communication**
- ❌ Before: Extensions work in isolation
- ✅ After: Extensions can talk to each other, share data, collaborate

### 3. **Task Orchestration**
- ❌ Before: One extension per task
- ✅ After: Complex tasks split across multiple specialized extensions

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
User Request
    ↓
[Router] → Analyzes intent
    ↓
[Orchestrator] → Plans execution
    ↓
[Extensions] → Execute in parallel/sequence
    ↓
[Event Bus] → Extensions communicate
    ↓
[Aggregator] → Combines results
    ↓
Final Response
```

## 💡 Real-World Example

**User asks**: "Analyze this article and find investment opportunities"

**System response**:
1. `topic-extractor` → Identifies key themes
2. `financial-analyzer` → Finds financial data
3. `market-researcher` → Checks market trends
4. `risk-assessor` → Evaluates risks
5. `report-generator` → Creates final report

All extensions work together, sharing insights!

## 🛠️ Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Extension registry with capabilities
- Basic event bus for communication

### Phase 2: Communication (Weeks 3-4)
- Inter-extension messaging
- Enhanced IPC layer

### Phase 3: Routing (Weeks 5-6)
- Intent analysis
- Smart routing decisions

### Phase 4: Orchestration (Weeks 7-8)
- Task decomposition
- Result aggregation

### Phase 5: Advanced (Weeks 9-10)
- ML-based optimization
- Developer tools

## 📝 Extension Manifest Changes

```json
{
  "id": "my-extension",
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "id": "analyze_sentiment",
      "description": "Analyzes text sentiment",
      "inputSchema": {...},
      "outputSchema": {...}
    }
  ],
  "communication": {
    "subscribes": ["page.loaded"],
    "publishes": ["sentiment.analyzed"],
    "dependencies": ["translator", "summarizer"]
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Migration Path

1. **Existing code continues to work** (backward compatible)
2. **Gradual enhancement** of extensions with new capabilities
3. **Opt-in routing** - start with specific use cases

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Speed**: Route decisions < 100ms
- **Reliability**: 99.9% message delivery
- **Quality**: Better results through specialization
- **Developer Experience**: < 1 hour to integrate

## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

### Making Your Extension Collaborative

```typescript
// Old way
async execute(data) {
  return processData(data);
}

// New way
async execute(data, { emit, call }) {
  // Process your part
  const myResult = processData(data);
  
  // Share with others
  await emit('data.processed', myResult);
  
  // Use another extension
  const enhanced = await call('enhancer', myResult);
  
  return enhanced;
}
```

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **For Users**
   - Better, more comprehensive results
   - Faster execution through parallelization
   - Transparent multi-agent collaboration

2. **For Developers**
   - Build focused, specialized extensions
   - Leverage other extensions' capabilities
   - Rich ecosystem of interoperable tools

3. **For the Platform**
   - Scalable architecture
   - Marketplace-ready design
   - Future-proof extensibility
