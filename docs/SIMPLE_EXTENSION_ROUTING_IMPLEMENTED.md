# Simple Extension Routing - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a **minimal, practical extension routing system** using a `master.json` file and Python-based intelligent routing. This provides multi-agent capability without the complexity of the full architecture.

## What We Built

### 1. **Master Configuration File** (`extensions/master.json`)
A simple JSON file that describes available extensions:

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    {
      "id": "topic-agent",
      "name": "Topic Agent", 
      "description": "Analyzes web page content to extract main topics...",
      "keywords": ["topic", "subject", "analyze", "summarize", "content"],
      "intents": ["analyze_page", "summarize", "extract_topics"],
      "category": "content_analysis",
      "priority": 8
    }
  ],
  "routing": {
    "defaultExtension": "topic-agent",
    "confidenceThreshold": 0.3
  }
}
```

### 2. **Python Router** (`extensions-framework/core/extension_router.py`)
Intelligent routing engine that:
- **Keyword Matching**: Exact matches get score +1.0
- **Intent Matching**: Fuzzy intent matching gets score +1.5  
- **Semantic Analysis**: Basic word overlap analysis
- **Priority Weighting**: Higher priority extensions get slight boost
- **Confidence Thresholding**: Falls back to default if confidence < 0.3

### 3. **ExtensionManager Integration**
- `routeRequest(userRequest)` method calls Python router
- `route-extension-request` IPC handler for frontend
- Robust error handling with fallbacks

### 4. **Frontend Integration**
Updated renderer to use intelligent routing instead of hardcoded extension selection:
- **Manual queries**: Routes based on user's question
- **Auto-summarization**: Routes based on page title/content  
- **Follow-up questions**: Routes based on question context

## Example Routing

```bash
# Test 1: Content analysis
$ python3 extension_router.py extensions "summarize this article"
→ Routes to: topic-agent (confidence: 2.7)
→ Reason: Matched keywords: summarize

# Test 2: Testing/Demo
$ python3 extension_router.py extensions "test the demo agent"  
→ Routes to: example-python-agent (confidence: 5.356)
→ Reason: Matched keywords: test, demo, agent
```

## Key Benefits

### ✅ **Simplicity**
- Just a JSON file and Python script
- No complex ML models or databases
- Easy to understand and maintain

### ✅ **Extensibility** 
- Add new extensions by updating `master.json`
- No code changes required for new extensions
- Easy to adjust routing logic

### ✅ **Intelligence**
- Keyword and intent-based matching
- Confidence scoring and fallbacks
- Priority-based routing

### ✅ **Production Ready**
- Works in packaged Electron apps
- Proper error handling
- Framework-level integration

## Usage for Developers

### Adding a New Extension

1. **Create extension** in `/extensions/my-new-agent/`

2. **Update master.json**:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "my-new-agent",
     "name": "My New Agent",
     "description": "Specializes in financial analysis and market research",
     "keywords": ["finance", "stocks", "market", "investment", "trading"],
     "intents": ["analyze_financial_data", "research_market", "investment_advice"],
     "category": "financial_analysis", 
     "priority": 7,
     "directory": "my-new-agent",
     "type": "python_agent",
     "enabled": true
   }
   ```

3. **That's it!** The router will automatically route relevant queries to your extension.

### Testing Routing

```bash
# Test your extension routing
python3 extensions-framework/core/extension_router.py extensions "analyze this stock"
# Should route to your financial agent if keywords match
```

## Router Logic

The router calculates a match score for each extension:

```python
score = 0.0

# Keyword matches: +1.0 each
for keyword in extension.keywords:
    if keyword in user_request:
        score += 1.0

# Intent matches: +1.5 each  
for intent in extension.intents:
    if intent_matches_fuzzy(intent, user_request):
        score += 1.5

# Description overlap: +0.2 per word
common_words = overlap(user_request, extension.description)
score += len(common_words) * 0.2

# Priority boost: slight multiplier
score *= (1 + priority/100)
```

Best scoring extension above threshold wins!

## Next Steps

### Immediate Enhancements
1. **Add more extensions** to the master.json
2. **Tune keyword/intent lists** for better routing
3. **Adjust confidence threshold** based on usage

### Future Improvements
1. **Machine Learning**: Train on user routing feedback
2. **Context Awareness**: Consider page content in routing
3. **Multi-Extension**: Route to multiple extensions for complex tasks
4. **Performance Caching**: Cache routing decisions
