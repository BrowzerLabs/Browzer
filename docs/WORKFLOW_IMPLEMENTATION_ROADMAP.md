# Workflow Orchestration Implementation Roadmap

**Goal**: Practical step-by-step guide for implementing multi-agent workflow orchestration.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start (4-Week Plan)

### Week 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Basic sequential workflows (A â†’ B)

**Key Tasks**:
1. Enhance intent analysis to detect multi-step queries
2. Create workflow execution framework
3. Implement research â†’ summarize pipeline
4. Test end-to-end workflow

**Success Criteria**: 
- Query "research AI and summarize in 500 words" works completely
- Extensions can receive and process previous results
- UI shows workflow progress

### Week 2: Core Orchestration  
**Goal**: Robust workflow management

**Key Tasks**:
1. Build centralized workflow manager
2. Add inter-extension communication protocol
3. Enhance extensions for workflow awareness
4. Implement error handling and recovery

**Success Criteria**:
- Complex workflows execute reliably
- Extensions share data properly
- Failures handled gracefully

### Week 3: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Parallel and conditional workflows

**Key Tasks**:
1. Add parallel execution capability
2. Implement conditional workflow logic
3. Create intelligent result aggregation
4. Build comparison and analysis workflows

**Success Criteria**:
- Parallel research works
- Conditional fact-checking implemented
- Results intelligently combined

### Week 4: Production Ready
**Goal**: Performance and reliability

**Key Tasks**:
1. Optimize performance and caching
2. Add comprehensive monitoring
3. Implement analytics and metrics
4. Complete testing and documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- System performs well under load
- All metrics tracked
- Ready for production deployment

## ðŸ›  Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Enhanced Intent Analysis

**Files to Create**:
- `extensions-framework/core/workflow_analyzer.py`
- `extensions-framework/core/workflow_executor.py`

**Key Components**:
```python
class WorkflowAnalyzer:
    def analyze_query(self, query: str) -> WorkflowAnalysis
    def detect_multiple_intents(self, query: str) -> List[str]
    def create_workflow_plan(self, intents: List[str]) -> WorkflowPlan
```

### Phase 2: Workflow Execution

**Files to Create**:
- `extensions-framework/core/workflow_context.py`
- `extensions-framework/core/pipeline_builder.py`

**Key Components**:
```python
class WorkflowExecutor:
    def execute_sequential(self, plan: WorkflowPlan) -> WorkflowResult
    def execute_parallel(self, plan: WorkflowPlan) -> WorkflowResult
    def handle_errors(self, context: WorkflowContext) -> RecoveryAction
```

### Phase 3: Extension Integration

**Files to Modify**:
- `extensions/cmbs76uhb0001d1qlpwoj9tbr/topic_agent.py`
- `extensions/cmbss0xti000189u7j28kyfic/research_agent.py`

**Key Changes**:
- Add workflow context handling
- Process previous extension results
- Modify behavior based on workflow position

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/main/ExtensionManager.ts`
- `src/renderer/index.ts`

**Key Changes**:
- Route to workflows instead of single extensions
- Display workflow progress
- Handle complex result structures

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

### Test Cases
1. **Simple Sequential**: research â†’ summarize
2. **Parallel Research**: multiple sources â†’ comparison
3. **Conditional Logic**: research â†’ fact-check if needed
4. **Error Handling**: extension failure recovery

### Success Metrics
- Workflow completion rate > 95%
- Average execution time < 30 seconds
- User satisfaction with multi-step results
- System reliability under load

## ðŸ“‹ Example Workflows to Implement

### Research + Summarize
```
Input: "Research blockchain adoption and summarize in 300 words"
Pipeline: research-agent â†’ topic-agent
Output: Comprehensive 300-word research summary
```

### Comparative Analysis
```
Input: "Compare renewable vs fossil fuel energy"
Pipeline: [research-agent(renewable), research-agent(fossil)] â†’ comparison-agent
Output: Detailed comparison with evidence
```

### Fact-Checking Pipeline
```
Input: "Research this claim and verify its accuracy"
Pipeline: research-agent â†’ fact-check-agent â†’ topic-agent
Output: Verified analysis with credibility assessment
```

This roadmap provides a clear path from current single-extension routing to full multi-agent workflow orchestration, enabling complex tasks like "research X and summarize in Y words" to work seamlessly.
